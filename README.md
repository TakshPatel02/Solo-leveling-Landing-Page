## Features

### Built with Tailwind CSS Utility Classes

This landing page leverages Tailwind's utility-first approach to deliver a fast, efficient, and maintainable design:

- **⚡ Blazing Fast Development** — Rapidly prototype and build responsive layouts using utility classes directly in HTML without switching between files.

- **📦 Minimal CSS Overhead** — Tailwind's utility classes eliminate redundant CSS. Only the styles you use are applied, keeping the stylesheet lean and load times fast.

- **🎨 Consistent Design System** — Predefined spacing, colors, and typography scales ensure visual consistency across the entire page without custom CSS.

- **📱 Responsive by Default** — Tailwind's responsive modifiers (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) make it effortless to create mobile-first, adaptive layouts that work seamlessly across all devices.

- **🔧 Highly Customizable** — Easily extend or override Tailwind's defaults via configuration to match your brand or design requirements.

- **♻️ Reusable Components** — Utility classes encourage component-based thinking, making it simple to extract and reuse design patterns throughout the project.

- **🚀 Production-Ready Performance** — With PurgeCSS integration, unused styles are automatically removed in production builds, resulting in incredibly small CSS bundles and faster page loads.
